# HK_SuperProject
A python script that can hold multiple scripts within it.

This script will alow you to put multiple python scripts inside one python script.

The reason why I created this script was because I had to use Replit for my school. Replit only allows you to create 3 projects on the free version, so I designed this script that would allow you to have unlimited projects by creating a "super project" as I call it. Instead of using multiple python projects, you can use only one "super project" to get the same job done.
